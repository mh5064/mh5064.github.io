This is the reposity that our team is using for the Foundations of Networks Lab 3. 

Our team members are:
 - Mahfuj Hussain

 - Michelle Florin
 
We began our lab by importing a bootstrap template from HTML5 UP, free under Creative Commons Attribution 3.0.

Here is some recognition:
Strata by HTML5 UP

The changes to the original repo include:
 - Wploaded HTML and CSS files from template
 - Changed website title and general text
 - Removed significant, unneeded chunks of HTML code
 - Uploaded new image of the team and mapped and formatted image using HTML tags
 - Changed social links to redirect to this github page
 - Changed button to redirect to course Brightspace
 - Added additional text with portfolio information using paragraph tags and unordered lists
